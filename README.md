# SIMPLE-UI-Core
There are no presets such as Sbutton, only the SIMPLE-UI framework of the Scontrol base class.
We don't recommend developers to download this version of the SIMPLE-UI framework, unless you need a better UI like Qt and hope define your own controls, if you just need a simple UI, go to the full version of SIMPLE-UI:
