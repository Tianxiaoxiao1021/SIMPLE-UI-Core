# SIMPLE-UI-Core
SIMPLE-UI-Core is essentially a SIMPLE-UI framework with presets removed, retaining the core signal processing mechanisms and OpenGL-based rendering engine, etc.
We don't recommend developers to download this version of the SIMPLE-UI framework, unless you need a better UI like Qt and hope define your own controls. If you just need a simple UI, go to the full version of SIMPLE-UI:
